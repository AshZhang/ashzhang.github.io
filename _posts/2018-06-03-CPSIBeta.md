## Hey Mac User!
Thanks a lot for helping me playtest this game. IMPORTANT Please read these directions before playing or you will probably be confused. They are not written in the game itself.

## Controls
WASD/Arrow keys to move
Space/click to shoot

## What's this game?
It's basically Space Invaders but with references to compsci and other things from Intro & AP. There are powerups based on CS concepts, explained in next section.

## Powerups
Powerups randomly drop from aliens you have destroyed. Idk how to put pictures of them here, so I'll try to describe them as best as I can.
- Round gray thing outlined in black - For loop: You shoot 3 bullets at once
- Blue square thing - Arraylist: You shoot 1 bullet, which will destroy the alien it hits PLUS the alien to the left, right, and above.
- Yellow triangle thing - OOP: Press space once to shoot a parent bullet, and then press space again to shoot 3 children bullets outward from where the parent bullet was.
- White square thing with green and blue inside - TA: Spawns 2 helper ships that move back and forth and shoot automatically. They will be destroyed after 2 hits from alien bullets. If a powerup drops on them, nothing happens (the powerup is destroyed).
- Orange rectangle thing - Recursion: Spawns 3 stacks of protective walls you can hide behind. Alien bullets will slowly destroy the stacks, but your bullets will not do anything to them. Your bullets also won't go through the stacks, however.
- Pumpkin - Extra life

## Other notes
Recommended to play the CompSci level first. That's it, feedback welcome!
