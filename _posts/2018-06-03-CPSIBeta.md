## Ms. Paymer's Code Defenders
In celebration of Ms. Paymer's 8 years of service at Campo, you are invited to play Ms. Paymer's Code Defenders! Pick from 7 different levels and blast those bugs! Please read the instructions before playing as they explain a lot. Instructions are not included in the game itself.

## How does this game work?
This game is basically Space Invaders (with powerups) - shoot at the aliens, and don't let them shoot you! If you touch an alien, it's an instant game over!

## Controls
- WASD/Arrow keys to move
- Space/click to shoot

## Powerups
Powerups drop randomly when you destroy an alien.
- ![For loop](images/loop powerup.png) For loop - shoot 3 bullets at once
- ![Array](images/arraylist powerup.png) Array - destroy the alien you hit, plus the alien to the left, right, and above
- ![OOP](images/OOP powerup.png) OOP - shoot once to fire a parent bullet. Shoot again to split the parent bullet into 3 children bullets.
- ![recursion](images/recursion powerup.png) Recursion - spawns 3 protective stacks you can hide behind. Alien bullets will chip away at the stacks, but your bullets won't do anything to them. However, your bullets also cannot pass through the stacks.
- ![TA](images/TA powerup.png) TA - spawns 2 helper ships that will move back and forth and fire automatically.  They only have 2 lives.
- ![pumpkin](images/pumpkin powerup.png) Pumpkin - extra life
